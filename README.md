# UFOs

## Purpose
We were tasked to create a page for UFO hunters to view past reportings of ufos. The site has multiple filters (including: data, city, statem country and shape) to help pin point the specific data they are looking for.

## Areas to improve
the table and filters although a great concept are not exactly user friendly. you need to know to press ENTER or TAB after specifing the specific field. If we added a search button I think that would go a long ways as a more intuitive for a more easy of use of the site.
